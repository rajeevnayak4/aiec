              There are 5 types of higher education institutions that international students can be admitted to, which are:

            <h2>Why Study in Japan from Nepal?</h2>
            <h3>Tuition Fees</h3>
            <p>
                The fact that both domestic and foreign students must pay the same tuition is the most excellent thing about Japan. 
                In the first year, admission fees are generally charged by Japanese schools. In the first semester, the cost is approximately 50,000 Yen. 
                About $7,000 (or 7,50,000 Yen) will be required for the first year. 
                The price is slightly higher for public universities; it might reach $8,000. <br><br> In a similar manner, private universities charge about $15,000 each year. However, costs may vary from one school to another. For instance, the top-tier vocational college Senmon Gakko will set you back roughly $11,700. 
                Technical degrees in fields like medicine, engineering, and the arts are slightly more expensive than those in humanities and business-related fields.
            </p>

            <h3>Cost Of Living In Japan</h3>
            <p>
                You must also invest in living expenses in addition to paying for your education. 
                This covers supper, lodging, electricity, and transportation. 
                The city in which you are staying has an impact on the cost of living as well. 
                You might expect to pay less in a small town than in a major metropolis like Tokyo.
                <br><br>The cost of living is primarily determined by where you live, so you may save a lot of money if you can find a lovely apartment for a fair price. 
                It’s not entirely accurate to say that Japan is very expensive. When you consider the quality, the food is relatively affordable here, and you can also find good electricity and transportation services.
            </p>

            <h3>Students Working In Japan</h3>
            <span>Can college students work in Japan?</span>
            <p>
                In general, students on student visas are not permitted to work. However, if their work won’t interfere with their studies, they are allowed to work up to 28 hours each week.
            </p>
            <span>How long can students in Japan work?</span>
            <p>
                You can only work up to 28 hours per week while you’re a student. Students may also work a total of 112 hours in a month. Nepalese students can work 8 hours a day if your university gives them long-term breaks or vacations.
            </p>

                  Japanese are especially proud of theirs’ language and culture, and want the foreigners to communicate in Japanese language. 
                  As such, strong command on Japanese language is one of the most surest and reliable means to achieve success in Japan. 
                  So, the first and foremost challenge is to own a command on Japanese language. 
                  Besides, the alien culture and strict working culture might make you bored and frustrated. 
                  As we are born in a society where business culture and right timing is not valid up to the standard. 
                  So you need to have the proficiency in language. The culture is also completely new for us.
